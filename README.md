## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

This application employs a modern full-stack architecture:

* **Frontend (React.js):** Manages the user interface, leverages WebRTC APIs for media capture and display, and communicates with the backend via Socket.IO for signaling and chat.
* **Backend (Node.js/Express.js):** Handles API requests, database interactions (MongoDB), and serves as the Socket.IO signaling server for WebRTC peer discovery and connection establishment.
* **Real-time Layer (WebSockets/Socket.IO):** Facilitates instantaneous, bidirectional communication for signaling WebRTC connections (e.g., exchanging SDP offers/answers, ICE candidates) and managing the real-time chat functionality.
* **Database (MongoDB):** Stores user data, chat history, and room information, ensuring persistence across sessions.
